<p>During a 2011 interview with London Evening Standard, Monáe said that she "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter-ego found in many of her songs. She also said, "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a black woman... what I want is for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'other' to connect with the music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.' " She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation "in due time".[102] In 2013, Monáe stated that she wants both men and women to "still be attracted to [her]" and expressed support for the LGBTQ community.[109]

In April 2018, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Monáe said about her sexuality: "Being a queer black woman in America—someone who has been in relationships with both men and women—I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker." She has said that she identifies with both bisexuality and pansexuality.[19]</p>
