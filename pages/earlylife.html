<h2 id="early-life">Early Life</h2>
<p>Monáe was born in Kansas City, Kansas, and was raised in its working-class community Quindaro.[19] She is the daughter of a janitor mother, Janet,[19] and a truck driver father, Michael Robinson Summers.[20] She dreamed of being a singer and a performer from a very young age,[18] and has cited the fictional character of Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz as a musical influence.</p>

<p>She moved to New York City to study drama at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, attending a performing arts camp called Freedom Theatre, the oldest African-American theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[clarification needed ][when? ] After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2001, she met OutKast's Big Boi, who served as a mentor and sponsor for the early part of her career[21], before founding the Wondaland Arts Society with some like-minded young artists. She released her first EP The Audition in 2003. Reportedly limited to only 400 physical copies, it showcased her vocal abilities and alluded to the film Metropolis, a concept that would also figure in her future releases.</p><p>

Monáe later appeared on OutKast's album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs "Call the Law" and "In Your Dreams". Big Boi told his friend Sean Combs about Monáe, whom at the time Combs had not yet heard. Combs soon visited Monáe's MySpace page and according to a HitQuarters interview with Bad Boy Records A&R person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it right away: "[He] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved the way she was dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh."[22] Monáe signed to Bad Boy in 2006. The label's chief role was in facilitating her exposure on a much broader scale rather than developing the artist and her music, because in the words of Mitchell, "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment".[22]</p></details>
